# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis

This project includes missing value imputation, feature engineering, data visualization to understand the bookings between two different hotels, trying various classification models to predict the likelihood of a booking getting cancelled, and using time series analysis to forecast demand in the future and to forecast the cancellation percentage in the future.

This project was a joint effort by Rawini Dias, Sadhana Koneni, Neha Anna John, and Christopher Fitzgerald.
